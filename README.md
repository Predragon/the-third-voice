# The Third Voice - Healing Communication, One Message at a Time

## Built by a Father Fighting to Come Home

This project was born from personal pain. After 15 months of separation from my 6-year-old daughter Samantha due to communication breakdowns, I'm building the tool I wish had existed.

## The Mission
Prevent family destruction through better communication. Every feature is designed to help families stay together.

## Current Status
